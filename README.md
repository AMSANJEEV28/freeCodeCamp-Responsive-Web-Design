## Revision of HTML-CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
First, build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
